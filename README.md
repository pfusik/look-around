Look Around
===========

"Look Around" is a
[demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) production for 
[8-bit Atari computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family).
It presents eight
[IFS fractals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system)
with music in just 883 bytes.

"Look Around" took first place in the Atari 8-bit 1 kilobyte intro
competition at [Forever 14 Party](http://www.forever-party.net/).

The intro was designed for PAL Ataris.
If run on NTSC, music plays too fast and colors are different.

A version for machines with just 16 KB RAM is incomplete.
Contact me if you're interested.
